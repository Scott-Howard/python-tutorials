# First Scripts  

## Will use the IDLE and Interactive window

Open a shell terminal - in a terminal type py and then enter.

This can be used to test oput small snippets but it isnt recoded or saved anywhere.  

## Interactive Window  
Open a new file in text editor (vscode for me etc). Add in your code and execute. THe output will print to the terminal.
