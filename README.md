# Overview, Notes and Comments/Reflections
## Personal Background  
Currently I am employed as a data analyst with ADHD and ASD. I have trouble learning end to end without structure but also hate too much structure. Ironic isn't it.  
I have 14 years as an electrican before heading to university to do a mathematics degree. I added mechatronics engineering to it and realised that awas a mistake after a few years. I finished with a Statistics degree and an honours degree.
We did a course in C/Matlab for engineering. Multiple Statistivs courses used R without a lot of training on good practices and 1 course I had a lecturer force python on us without a solid background/understanding.
